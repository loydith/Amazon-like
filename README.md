## run ==> bamazonManager.js

1.- If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.



2. If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.


3. If a manager selects Add to Inventory, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.



4. If a manager selects Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
